# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Installing

```shell
npm install
```

## Code Formatting

Recommended extensions for VSCode for formatting on save - these shouldn't require additional configuration -
[EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

You can also format a file in place (commit first to be safe)

```shell
npm run format:fix <path>
```

## Linting

VSCode integration:
[TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint)

You can also lint all files at once:

```shell
npm run lint
```
